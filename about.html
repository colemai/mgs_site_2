        <p> The delightfully named “Irritable Bowel Syndrome” is the most common gastrointestinal condition in the Western World. It affects 15% of the population. Due to the sensitive nature of the condition, it is largely undiagnosed. It is a chronic functional bowel disorder* characterised with abdominal pain symptoms and altered bowel habit (constipation and diarrhoea). Although IBS can be debilitating, unlike Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), it is not a life-limiting condition. IBS is twice as likely to occur in women as in men and most often affects people between the ages of 20 and 30 years. People with IBS frequently report the negative impact the condition has on their relationships and their ability to engage in work and social interactions.</p>

	       <p>IBS is categorised into four different subtypes depending on which stool type you most commonly experience;</p>

            <ul>
	               <li>IBS-D diarrhoea dominant</li>
	               <li>IBS-C constipation dominant</li>
	               <li>IBS-M mixed (diarrhoea & constipation) and</li>
	               <li>IBS-U unclassified</li>
            </ul>

          <div>
                <p> IBS is also classified into 3 levels of severity; mild, moderate and severe.</p>

            <p> The underlying mechanism behind the condition is not well understood but it is generally agreed that its causes are “biopsychosocial” in nature. This implies that a combination of biological, psychological and social factors are at play.

        <p> Symptoms of IBS are wide ranging and different symptoms can affect the same person at different times. Primary symptoms:</p>

            <ul>
              	<li>Abdominal pain and/or discomfort</li>
              	<li>Bloating</li>
              	<li>Change in bowel habit (diarrhoea, constipation or both)</li>
              	<li>Frustrated defecation (needing to go to the toilet but not being able to)</li>
                <li>Urgency to go to the toilet</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Secondary symptoms</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tiredness</li>
                <li>Heartburn</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Indigestion</li>
                <li>Headaches</li>
                <li>Anxiety</li>
                <li>Depression</li>
            </ul>

        <p>There are many symptoms that are not common in IBS. These are called Red Flag symptoms. Sometimes, people will label themselves as having IBS, when in fact they may have undiagnosed coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, upper or low gastric cancer or even ovarian cancer. That is why it is so important to receive your IBS diagnosis from your medical doctor.</p>

        <p>The diagnosis of IBS relies on 2 things.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>After other bowel and gut related conditions are ruled out. If you are experiencing digestive symptoms it is important to seek professional advice from your doctor or registered allied healthcare professional.</li>
                <li>meeting the Rome IV Criteria. Experts who works in the area of functional gut disorders, form an organisation called The Rome Foundation. They have outlined the symptoms, and the frequency of these symptoms that someone needs to receive a diagnosis of IBS:</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with 2 or more of the following:<p>

            <ul>
                <li>Related to defecation (passing a bowel motion).</li>
                <li>Associated with a change in a frequency of stool.</li>
                <li>Associated with a change in the form of the stool. </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>IBS-C</b>(Constipation Predominant)

              <ul>
                  <li> >25% of bowel motions are type 1 or 2 and</li>
                  <li> <25% of bowel movements are type 6 or 7 as per the Bristol Stool Chart.</li></p>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                  <li>>25% of bowel motions are type 6 or 7 and</li>
                  <li><25% of bowel movements are type 1 or 2 as per the Bristol Stool Chart.</li></p>
              </ul>

            <p><b>IBS-M</b>(Mixed bowel habits)

              <ul>
                  <li>>25% of bowel motions are type 1 or 2 and</li>
                  <li>> 25% of bowel movements are type 6 or 7 as per the Bristol Stool Chart.</li>
              </ul>

            <p><b>IBS-U</b> (Unclassified)

              <ul>
                <li>You meet the criteria for IBS but your bowel habits cannot be accurately categorized into 1 of 3 groups above.</li></p>
              </ul>


            <p>Stools/Poo can be described according to their appearance. The Bristol Stool chart describes seven types of stools.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Type 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts</li>
                <li>Type 2: Sausage-like but lumpy</li>
                <li>Type 3 :Like a sausage but with cracks in the surface</li>
                <li>Type 4 :Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft</li>
                <li>Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges</li>
                <li>Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool</li>
                <li>Type 7: Watery, no solid pieces</li>
              </ul>

            </p>

            <p>Unfortunately there is no one single test to diagnose IBS. Instead your doctor is likely to take a full history of your symptoms, perform a physical exam and rule out conditions such as coeliac disease and other conditions. They may also run a number of tests such as tests on your blood and poo to rule out possible infections or other diseases.</p>

            <p>In relation to your symptoms you doctor may ask you the following things:

              <ul>
                <li>How frequently they appear for you</li>
                <li>How often you get them</li>
                <li>When do you get them</li>
                <li>How long they last for</li>
              </ul>

            </p>

            <p>It can be useful to keep a food and symptom diary for a number of days before going to see your doctor.</p>

        <p>Many treatments have been researched for IBS. Some work better than others.  Many treatment options available for sale are not backed by scientific investigation or are even discredited by scientific investigation. This is another reason to stick to registered healthcare professionals for diagnosis and treatment. But there are guidelines that help us determine the steps that need to be undertaken whenever healthcare professionals are trying to help people with IBS.</p>

        <p>The first step in treating your IBS is typically to implement general dietary and lifestyle changes, as discussed below. Sometimes a doctor might recommend symptom-relieving medications or probiotics. You may also have the option of psychological intervention such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) or hypnotherapy, following dietetic treatment.</p>

    <img src="assets/img/sandwich-min.png" class="responsive" width="600" height="400">

        <p>The first step in treating your IBS should be an assessment of your diet and lifestyle. Ideally this should be done with an IBS-specialist dietitian who can educate and guide you on the best practices to put in place to manage your IBS.</p>

        <p>If appropriate your dietitian may recommend you follow a specific diet. The most effective diet for those with IBS is known as the Low-FODMAP diet. This diet carried out in conjunction with a dietitian has been proven to reduce symptoms by 70% in those with IBS.</p>

        <p>The acronym FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols which are different types of highly fermentable carbohydrates found in the diet. For many people who have IBS these carbohydrates are either poorly absorbed or aren’t digested fully in the small intestine and end up making their way to the large intestine (colon). Here the gut bacteria consume these sugars in a process known as fermentation. This fermentation process releases gases which is believed to drive to some of the common symptoms in IBS. It is important to note that the fermentation process is a natural part of our digestive system, however rapid fermentation and production of large amounts of gases can cause symptoms in those with IBS.</p>

            <p>The Low-FODMAP diet is a 3 stage process which includes

              <ol>
                <li>Elimination - Removing these food groups for a period of time.</li>
                <li>Reintroduction - Testing your tolerance level to each FODMAP, one at a time.</li>
                <li>Maintenance - Creating a personalised diet by reintroducing these foods back into your diet at your tolerance levels.</li>

        <p>It is important that people don’t remain on the elimination phase of the low-FODMAP diet long term as this can cause problems with the balance of your gut bacteria. Although some or all of these FODMAP foods can cause symptoms for those with IBS they play a key role in maintaining the health of gut microbiome. By figuring out your individual tolerance level (how much you can consume without symptoms) we are ensuring you are keeping the good bacteria healthy while reducing your IBS symptoms.</p>

        <p>My Gut Solution provides the ideal package. Our app offers videos, audiocasts and resources containing diet and lifestyle tips specifically formulated by our expert IBS dietitian. You can also log your meals and symptoms and through our “Ask A Dietitian” portal can get feedback on what might be causing your issues. We also guide you through the Low-FODMAP process, setting you up for success and ensuring you can get a handle on your IBS once and for all.</p>

        <p>Certain psychological interventions have been clinically proven to help those with IBS cope with their symptoms. These include both Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).</p>

        <p>CBT is the most commonly known psychological approach for helping people with IBS. As dietary counselling is considered to be the go-to IBS treatment option, we often find that psychological therapies are reserved for those who have not responded to dietetic intervention.</p>

        <p>ACT in particular is a new promising method which offers a new, refreshing perspective on the management of IBS. ACT focuses on the process of acceptance as well as mindfulness, the act of being present in the now. ACT encourages us to be aware of our thoughts, emotions, memories or physical sensations which, has emerged in the scientific literature as a particularly potent therapy for IBS.</p>

        <p>Within My Gut Solution we have a number of ACT modules which you can access. We teach you the basic principles of ACT and how to incorporate the practice into your daily life.</p>

            <p>Those with IBS often use other over-the-counter medications or supplements to help alleviate their symptoms. How well you respond to these medications/supplements varies hugely. Like any treatment, it’s important to evaluate their effectiveness by discussing them with your doctor at your appointments.

                <li>Peppermint oil e.g. Colpermin</li>
                <li>Laxatives e.g. Lactulose</li>
                <li>Antidiarrheals e.g. Imodium</li>
                <li>Antispasmodics e.g. Buscopan</li>
                <li>Probiotics e.g. Alforex, Symprove, Activia</li>
              </ul>

            </p>

        <p>In some instances you doctor may advise you to start a low dose of an antidepressant, most likely a TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) or an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or other types of medications such as linaclotide and rifaximin. Research has shown these treatments can be effective in certain circumstances.</p>
